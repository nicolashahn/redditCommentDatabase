Memories get fuzzy, evidence gets lost or tampered with. It's really hard to have a fair trial some twenty years after the incident.\n\nFurthermore, at some point people need to just know that they're not going to be hounded for a crime the rest of their life. This may sound like we're just giving up and letting the guilty man go, but in reality it's for the innocent-- if you're a suspect but there's not enough evidence to bring you to trial, you don't want to live the rest of your life waiting for the other shoe to drop, even if you didn't do it.\n\nAnd finally, not every crime has a statute of limitations.

{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhn3","author":"oh-bubbles","body":"\"General rule of thumb\", \"generally read\" - this is another one of my pet peeves we lump EVERY kid into ONE category. News flash - Every kid is different, some are more mature than others and CAPABLE of self-care. I was left at home for periods of time from the age of 7-8 on and I plan on doing the same with my kids. I was also watching infant siblings alone at 10-11 unsupervised. There are definitely kids who should not under any circumstances be left alone until their much older, but to shoe horn and entire age group into that because of those that aren't ready or capable is crazy. \n\nAs I previously stated (twice now for those who don't read), I would not personally leave a 4 or 5 year old at home alone, but to say its outright neglect is a bit of stretch IF the child has the maturity and ability to care for themselves, which in this situation seems to be the case, as I also previously stated, a discussion should still be had with the mother, but to completely go off and go OMG CPS NOW! Is, in my opinion, and overreaction, especially given the horror stories and the lack of support in the system.\n\n If OP were to call CPS and they showed up and the mother was not home... what are they going to do? Take the child, and what kind of trauma is that going to cause versus letting them be and they continue the way they have been for awhile that seems to be working FOR THEM. Everyone here seems to suggest, lets just unroot their lives by having CPS involved, so the mother has to be home for home visits, and will have to take time off work, which lets be honest probably isn't high paying where she can afford to take time off work, so now the mother is losing income and unable to provide, so now she truly may be unfit, since she's not able to provide the things that are needed.\n\nIt's slippery effing slope, and the fact that everyone is SO damn quick to call CPS is aggravating. Are there instances where it's warranted as a first response, hell yes it is, but is this one, I really, really don't think so.\n","parent_id":"t1_cnhzkow","retrieved_on":1424998318,"created_utc":"1420688448","link_id":"t3_2rk6fw","archived":false,"subreddit":"Parenting","score":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"cni0wyr","name":"t1_cni0wyr","ups":0,"downs":0,"score_hidden":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"controversiality":0}

No convicted nonviolent felon, save for those convicted of burglary or similar thievery, shall be compelled to reveal their felon status to any potential or actual employer.\n\nI disagree with Section 3B because, even though I applaud the sentiment that ex felons should be able to have normal jobs and careers, ALL businesses have the right to know about your criminal felony history. The bill mentions burglary or thievery, but there are so many ways that a felon's history could directly undermine the foundation of a company. For those of you arguing that it is a right of privacy, I argue that employers have the right to ask about your work history, previous employers, and even call your previous employers. Many will call past bosses for the purpose NOT of trying to eliminate or disqualify an applicant, but because they want to know the type of person the applicant is. I believe that a criminal history is absolutely within the employers right to ask for.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;SECTION 4. LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS\n\n&gt;The recreational use, possession, transportation, and sale of cannabis shall be legal for adults 21 years of age and above, and the drug shall be removed from the Schedule I list of the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nI agree that the drug should be removed from the Schedule 1 list of the Controlled substances act, and that the federal government should consider for all intents and purposes consider cannabis a legal substance above the federal prosecution of the government. HOWEVER, such a strong and still quite controversial statement effectively outlawing state and local enforcement of cannabis could prove disastrous. States are already slowly transitioning to allow medical marijuana dispensaries, and in come states, recreational marijuana dispensaries. **The fact that the sale of cannabis is expressly legalized without any regulation or licensing whatsoever is alarming.** I am against over-regulation and the stifling of entrepreneurship in general, the the absolute lack of any sort of regulation of a substance such as cannabis will essentially give complete un adulterated power to the drug cartels and gangs. Why? Because there is no infrastructure to support such a quick legalization except drug cartels, so the only entities that will have the financial ability to maintain and control such a business would be these violent cartels. Slowly allowing for states to legalize marijuana themselves and easing approved regulated businesses and dispensaries is the most wise option to combat the horrific gang violence in this country, funded almost entirely by drugs.\n\n","parent_id":"t3_2rodgr","author":"Libertarian-Party","subreddit_id":"t5_33mfm","controversiality":0,"edited":false,"distinguished":null,"score_hidden":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t1_cni0x2v","ups":2,"downs":0,"author_flair_css_class":"Gold","id":"cni0x2v","author_flair_text":"Libertarian","subreddit":"ModelUSGov","score":2}

You mentioned Evo (you were joking of course, nobody actually breaks the law like that) so this experience must have been within the past 10 months or so, right?\n\n As far as your drug combination, MDMA and LSD is a great idea. If you can, get more MDMA. Not to take all at once, but I like to redose either after hour 8 or 2 hours before dropping the L. It's like choosing if you want a super nice come up or super nice come down. As far as the weed goes, only smoke a little bit only if you already smoke a few days a week. Weed will send you to hyperspace on Lucy. In a crowded environment this can be VERY difficult or the most euphoric thing ever.

There is no disadvantage to anyone and as long as a team will decide to play on the servers close to them, they are not put at disadvantage. If they want to play elsewhere it is their decision to be at a disadvantage.\n\nyou say you want the best teams to qualify, but you also propose that every team can play on any server. I cannot understand how you think this can work. They are mutually exclusive, either you want the best teams to qualify, or you want any team to play on any server. if you are putting handicaps on team that chooses to play on different servers/regions, it will not cause the best teams to qualify. Sure, you can impose the handicaps, but you cannot say that method will produce/promote the best teams. \n\nFor example, team secret sees that the competition is weaker in NA region and decides to play there, they play complexity and lose because of ping issues, However, if they played in a neutral or switched servers every game they wouldve won. So the better team did not qualify. Sure, they imposed the handicap upon themselves, but by making the option of playing on different regions open, there will always be teams that will take this gamble, and thus there will be many games decided by pings alone. How will this promote/advance the better team? The only way to have the better team advance is for the two teams to play at a neutral ping setting, or use the methods I mentioned above, such as switching servers in a bo3, or one team chose side, one team chose server, something to alleviate the ping issue. and that cannot be done if you are forcing a handicap onto the teams that chose to play on other regions. \n\n\n&gt;The outcry was caused by unfair setting c9 in NA when majority of their players are in EU\n\ncorrect\n\n&gt; while rules states that teams assignment is based on players location\n\nI'm pretty sure region qualifiers are decided by the tournament organizers privately. \n\n&gt;While technically my solution would not change the team region assignment in this case, it would not cause an outcry, because everyone have an equal chance to put themselves in every region they want\n\nsure, some might think that if everyone had a choice and have an equal chance at something there would be no outcrys, but this is simply not true if you even think about it for a second. the option of choice only makes outcrys more often because you are allowed to do things that would you otherwise couldn't. For example, if valve added an item to the store where you would gain a 7th slot at the cost of 20 dollars a month, would this not cause outcrys? but isn't it available to everyone, and everyone has a equal chance of purchasing it? \n\nDo you really think there would be no outcry if IG or Vici played and qualified on the SEA server? or maybe if a mainly european team played on the NA server? like.. c9?\n\n&gt;If c9 decided to play on NA servers so let it be\n\nthis is literally the exact reason why people are complaining recently, C9 could've easily played on the euro qualifiers where they had better ping, but chose not request reassignment when they were assigned to the NA region, because they know the competition is weaker in NA.

To describe it by pointing out the extraordinary cases is not a useful metric. It should be described by noting the averages and the standard variations. That is: if you randomly selected a person - where are they likely to fall on a spectrum from atheist to fanatic?\n\nNow, it's an entirely different matter to talk about EFFECTS; the fanatical among us do tend to make substantial contributions compared to the size of their population. The mean probably skews one direction in this case - but that is not a case for completely ignoring the acts of kindness and charity that the average observer contributes to the world. An act of terrorism is definitely a more compact way of impacting society than giving food to a hungry man, but if we compare the total impact of all people committing acts of terror to that of all people feeding the poor, I think the crimes of the extremists will not looks so significant.","parent_id":"t1_cni0n0j","author":"syd_malicious","name":"t1_cni0x8h","ups":1,"downs":0,"author_flair_css_class":"","id":"cni0x8h","controversiality":0,"edited":false,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"DebateReligion","score":1,"author_flair_text":"humanist atheist"}

Sometimes stocks undergo a \"split\" - meaning each share represents a smaller piece of the company, and the share price is adjusted accordingly. This is why Apple's stock is now trading just over $100/share, whereas a year ago it was closer to $700. The company didn't lose value, it just did a 7:1 split, meaning that if you owned 100 shares, you now own 700 shares. Splits are common among companies that have a lot of growth. For example, Microsoft has split 9 times in its history, which is why its market cap is higher than, say, Google's, even though Google's stock price is a lot higher.","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3j5"}

The atoms of radioactive isotopes are naturally unstable and randomly decay over time. The atomic bomb takes advantage of this instability.  The nucleus of a uranium or plutonium atom is very packed with protons and neutrons and barely holds itself together.  Throw more neutrons into it and it can't help but break apart, releasing energy.  In an atomic explosion, a chain reaction occurs where one atom splits and sends off some of its neutrons into nearby atoms, which split and send more neutrons into other nearby atoms, and so on.  This results in an exponentially growing energy release that consumes lots of the nuclear fuel in a fraction of a second.  That release produces the explosive force and mushroom cloud we're all familiar with. Nuclear power plants operate on the same principle except we're controlling the reaction (at Chernobyl the reaction ran out of control and went boom, but that was only because of some serious mistakes).\n\nIf atomic bombs weren't enough, so-called h-bombs, or thermonuclear weapons, were developed that use the fission reaction described above as a means to induce hydrogen fusion--the same reaction that powers the sun--to release even more explosive force.

The VFX work in the first Transformers absolutely blows the Hobbit movies off the screen. The VFX in Jackson's new films is cartoonish, rubbery, and defys logical/natural motion. It's just plain fake looking. Some of the characters don't look real in the least. Optimus Prime looks photo real, and with the liberties taken during transformation aside, the transformers moved and functioned with logical physics in mind. As revolutionary as Gollum was in the LOTR's films he looks no better today. In a film with actual human actors (albeit playing dwarves and hobbits) Gollum standing next to Bilbo doesn't even look like they are in the same environment. It just looks and 'feels' fake. With the money and time that went into those films, that's unacceptable. Some the environment work and technical stuff like roto and comping is all fine and well in the Hobbit movies, but the action and character work is atrocious."}

The time frame they inhabit can indeed vary wildly depending on biochemical structure, metabolism, hell, even what you had for lunch. Those 24 hour drugs you're trying to mention are rare outside of indigenous cultures. The most common ones you'll see are mescaline and ayahuasca, with ayahuasca having the potential to last up to 36 hours (!!!) if you imbibe enough. \n\nHowever, as I have pointed out in another comment outside of this thread, LSD-25 (the substance in question) metabolizes in a way that *usually* lasts 10-12 hours... *unless you're taking heroic doses.* If you're taking a whole strip, sure, you're probably in for the long haul. But from my experience, and the experiences I've read on erowid and shared with friends, anything under 5 tabs and you're hovering safely in the 10-12 hour zone. Since this is predominantly the higher end of dosing any layman will do (unless of course you're heavy into ethneogens), 10-12 hours will be the acceptable average tripping time. \n\nYou're consistently using broad generalizations about hallucinogens as a whole, about a class of substances that contains multiple drugs that can behave wildly different from each other, to try and reinforce a technically correct *yet inaccurate* assertion about one particular substance. Shifting one molecule out of place can change the entire reaction, so using *completely different molecules* with *completely different chemical structures* will provide *wildly different results* even under the overarching umbrella of \"psychedelics.\" Psylocybin won't behave like dimethyltryptamine and ergine won't behave like lysergic acid diethlymide.
